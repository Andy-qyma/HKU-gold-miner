# Game Rule Description
* The player of this game plays as a gold miner in a 10*10 table. Firstly, there are two mode to choose from: Normal and Adventure (choose by input 1 or 2). In the normal mode, you need to win the most amount of gold you can within 5 chances in the normal mode. In the adventure mode, your goal is to win as much gold as you can until all the gold are mined or you mine the bomb. In each unit of the table, you have 3 possibility: gold with different scores (1~30), bomb or nothing. 
* Luckily, this is not a game totally for guessing and opportunity. We give you an instruction whenever you choose a unit. In the instruction, there will be two numbers in a row. The first number is the total amount of gold in the 3*3 table around and exclude the selected coordinates.
